## 📋 Coding Standards & Guidelines

### 🏷️ File Naming Convention
```
problem-name.extension
```
**Examples**: 
- `two-sum.java`
- `binary-search.py` 
- `merge-sort.cpp`

### 📄 Code Structure Template
```python
"""
Problem: [Problem Name]
Description: [Brief 1-2 line description]

Time Complexity: O(...)
Space Complexity: O(...)

Approach: [Brief explanation of your approach]
"""

def solution():
    # Your well-commented code here
    pass

# Test cases
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Add test cases to demonstrate your solution
    pass
```

### ✨ Code Quality Requirements
1. **Clear comments**: Explain logic, not just what the code does
2. **Meaningful variable names**: `left_pointer` not `l`
3. **Complexity analysis**: Always include time and space complexity
4. **Test cases**: Provide examples that demonstrate your solution
5. **Error handling**: Consider edge cases where appropriate
